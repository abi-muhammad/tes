      <p>
        Dear, My love..<br>
        I know ive never been the best boyfriend for you, sometimes, i think i do not deserve you, why? because sometimes or even madalas na feeling ko ampabigat ko sayo, sa relasyon nating dalawa. sorry if madalas ako magalit, sorry if madmai akong pag-kukulang sayo, and im sorry if andaming mali sa sarili ko. i hope you know that im still doing my best for you, for our relationship, i do mistakes but that theres something i do that you didnt know, and my friends only knows. they know how much i do care about you, how much i care about us, how much i love you. please be more patient for me until i can give eveyrthing you want/need. at this moment this is the only way i know how to give my efforts and how i show my love for you, to do what i love to do. Happy 9th monthsarry to us baby! its been so fast, i hope we get more stronger for more months/years we gonna spent together. i will always root for us, Iloveyouuusomuchhh, my future Teacher!
